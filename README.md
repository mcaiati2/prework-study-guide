# Mike's Prework Study Guide Webpage
## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I was motivated to build this site so that I could implement the items I have been learning in my prework course as real world examples.
- The Prework Study Guide Webpage was built so that my bootcamp notes will be neatly organized and viewable by fellow classmates.
- This helps solve the problem of organizing important notes, so that they are not scattered all throughout my computer and therefore easily misplaced.
- I learned how to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as completing the GitHub flow for each change as it was made.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section will contain notes for the corresponding topic. These sections will be updated as I learn more information that is important to the understanding and mastering of each topic. We can open the dev tools by right clicking on the page and choosing "Inspect". Once in the dev tools, we can use the Console tab to see the JavaScript running. I created a  JavaScript function that is used in this webpage show the list of topics that were covered in the prework. The second JavaScript function that was created will choose a topic at random that we should study first.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
